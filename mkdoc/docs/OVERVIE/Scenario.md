Miracle Cloud runs through the entire life cycle of bioinformatics analysis from Preprocessing to Processing to Postprocessing , and can be used for the entire analysis process of bioinformatics data from samples to reports. Miracle Cloud is based on an open and compatible architecture and takes workspace as the core of to help bioinformatics practitioners achieve the goals that analysis process could be restarted, the research results could be reproduced, the operation process could be traced, and the knowledge could be accumulated and disseminated. Typical application scenarios are as follows

- Bioinformatics data transmission, storage, management and display
	

- Secondary analysis of bioinformatics
	

- Third level analysis of bioinformatics
	

- Reproduction of typical research papers and books
	

- Submission of scientific papers
