A workspace is a computational sandbox created by a user on Miracle Cloud, which contains data, workflow, real-time interactive analysis environment and analysis results. Usually it is a complete project. The workspace can be used as a basic unit for data management, resource allocation, workflow configuration and paper delivery.

### Workspace Introduction

Workspace contains six parts: Dashboard, Data, Notebook, Workflow, Analysis History, and Environment Management.
**Dashboard:**  As an overall introduction to all the research done in Workspace, it can record information such as data resources, workflow resources and operation steps during the research process, and can also reproduce the research in Workspace through the interactive analysis environment.
**Data:**  Manage Bioinformatics data and data models, this is where you work begin.
**Notebooks:** Based on jupyter notebook, it help users visualize and analyze data of any scale by providing a real-time interactive analysis environment that meets the usage habits of Bioinformatical practitioners.
**Workflows:** Using flexible pipeline for batch processing genomics data.
**Job history:**  Record delivery analysis, workflow operation and multi-level task operation history **Environment:** Demonstrate information on currently used resource pools.
