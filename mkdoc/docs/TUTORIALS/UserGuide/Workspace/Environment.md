In Miracle Cloud, you can choose a cluster for the workflow or Notebook in the current workspace. Click on the environmental management in the left menu to see the current resource information. Workflows and NoteBooks can only be associated with a cluster. After the association, the workflow of the Workspace workflow will be delivered to the affiliated cluster, and Notebook will also start from the affiliated cluster. Workflows and NOTEBOOK can choose to associate with different clusters. The replacement cluster needs to be lifted and re-associated the new cluster.
