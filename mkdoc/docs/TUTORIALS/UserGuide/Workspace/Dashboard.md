The Dashboard contains basic information about the current workspace such as name, short description, creation time, and administrator, as well as the environment space such as compute resource pool, compute type, and bucket. Click the Edit button in the upper right corner to enter the Jupyter Notebook editing interface, where you can write the overview of the workspace using markdown . Of course, you can also use python or R language for interactive analysis, etc.
